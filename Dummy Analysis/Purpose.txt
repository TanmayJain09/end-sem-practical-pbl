See I am making the excel file for the teacher, that is in the process. Meanwhile I wanted to see analysing some of the data as well. Like a dummy analysing, but it would be good to understand the problem and the challenges prior starting anything...
So i would take an dummy excel workbook with multiple sheets in it, but i have the main attendance and the data inside a sheet named : Attendance.
