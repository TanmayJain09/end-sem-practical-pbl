# Student Data and Risk Analysis System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Data and Risk Analysis System** is an end-semester Practical Based Learning (PBL) project designed to collect, manage, and analyze student-related data in order to identify potential academic and behavioral risks.  
The system helps in early detection of at-risk students and supports data-driven decision-making for academic improvement.
