My proposed plan a macro excel file or a automated advance excel file...
So it would be like inside a workbook with two sheet. 
	Sheet 1 : Lecture list
Date	Time	Batch
25-2-26	9:30	Both
25-2-26	11:45	D1
25-2-26	14:30	D2
26-2-26	9:30	D1
	So everytime a lecture would be there then the teacher would add there and then click a button after which the sheet 2 would be updated
	
	Sheet 2 : Auto Format Updation List
	
	The Main Heading would be same like : 
Date	Time	Batch	PRN 	Name	Present

	But just that instead of typing the internal content manually this time it would be generated automatically after clicking the button
